# PARfolio Overview

## App Name
**PARfolio**

## User Persona
Mid-career professionals (especially in knowledge and product-driven roles) who struggle to recall, structure, and clearly communicate their work experiences when preparing for behavioral interviews or career reflection.

## Problem
They have valuable career stories in their head, but those stories are messy, unstructured, and easy to forget, making interview preparation time-consuming, stressful, and inconsistent.

## Solution
An AI-powered voice-first app that listens to rambling work stories, automatically structures them into a clear Problem–Action–Result format, categorizes them by interview competency, and stores them for easy retrieval.

## Benefit
Users gain confidence, clarity, and speed when preparing for interviews because their experiences are already organized, searchable, and interview-ready.

## Pitch
### Short
PARfolio helps professionals turn their spoken work experiences into structured, categorized career stories so they can prepare for behavioral interviews with clarity and confidence.

### Long
PARfolio helps mid-career professionals who struggle to clearly remember and explain their work experiences by turning their spoken, unstructured stories into organized, interview-ready narratives. This allows them to prepare for behavioral interviews faster, with more confidence and less stress.
