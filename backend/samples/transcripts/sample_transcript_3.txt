Yeah—so this is actually one of my favorite things I’ve worked on. We ended up increasing week-two retention by about seventeen percent in this part of the app, which, for us, was… massive. Like, leadership literally pulled the chart into the all-hands deck.
And the thing is, it didn’t come from some big roadmap initiative. It started because I built this little prototype that made our daily check-ins feel more like a conversation. Instead of just asking a flat list of questions, it would adapt in real time. So if someone said they slept badly, the next screen would acknowledge that and ask a relevant follow-up instead of just plowing ahead.
I hacked it together in React with mocked data—nothing production-ready, just enough to feel different. I dropped it in our engineering channel like, “Hey, I’ve been thinking about this, what if this felt more human?” And it kind of… took off. Design wanted to play with it, product asked if we could test it, and suddenly we had this scrappy little cross-functional group around something that wasn’t even on the roadmap.
We shipped a very lightweight version—just a few conditional paths—and ran an A/B test. And that’s where the seventeen percent bump came from.
Um—sorry, I realize I’m starting from the end. The reason this mattered in the first place was that our engagement had been flat. People would use the app for a week or two and then drop off. The flow technically worked, but it felt clinical, almost like filling out a form, even though we were asking really personal health questions.
So the actual problem was: users didn’t feel seen. And engineers, including me, were mostly just implementing whatever came out of design without really questioning that experience.
What I did was step back and say, “What if this felt less like a form and more like a conversation?” The prototype was just a way to make that idea tangible.
So, in the right order: we had a retention problem, I reframed the experience and built a quick demo to show a different approach, we tested it, and it materially moved the metric. But more than that, it changed how our team thought about ownership—engineers started bringing forward product ideas, and we created space for that.
That’s the part that really stuck with me.
