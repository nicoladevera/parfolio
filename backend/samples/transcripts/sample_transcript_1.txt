Yeah, um—so one that comes to mind is from about a year ago. We were in the middle of rolling out a big redesign of our onboarding flow, and it was… honestly kind of a mess. The product team had strong opinions, design was still iterating, and engineering was already feeling stretched because we were also supporting a major backend migration at the same time.
What started happening was that the team was getting blocked a lot. People were kind of working in silos, and standups were turning into status dumps instead of problem-solving. You could feel the frustration building, especially with some of the more junior engineers who didn’t feel comfortable pushing back on changing requirements.
So I decided to step in a bit more intentionally. I set up a separate working session with product, design, and the engineers on the squad—not a formal meeting, more like a working jam. My goal was just to get everyone in the same room and say, “Okay, what are we actually trying to ship in the next two weeks, and what can wait?”
I also started doing one-on-ones with the engineers on the team, especially the newer ones, just to understand what was blocking them and to give them space to voice concerns. In a couple of cases, I ended up being the one to take those concerns back to product, like, ‘Hey, this scope change is going to add a week—are we okay with that tradeoff?’
The result was that we cut the scope of the first release by almost half, but we shipped it on time, and it was stable. More importantly, the team’s energy shifted. Standups became more focused, people felt safer speaking up, and a few of the junior engineers later told me it was the first time they felt like their input really mattered.
That experience kind of cemented for me that leadership isn’t just about making technical decisions—it’s about creating clarity and psychological safety so the team can actually do their best work.
